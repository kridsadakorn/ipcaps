# R Package IPCAPS

## Summary

The R package ```IPCAPS``` is an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on 
iterative pruning to capture population structure. This version supports ordinal 
data which can be applied directly to SNP data to identify fine-level population 
structure and it is built on the iterative pruning Principal Component Analysis 
(ipPCA) algorithm (Intarapanich et al., 2009; Limpiti et al., 2011). The IPCAPS 
involves an iterative process using multiple splits based on multivariate 
Gaussian mixture modeling of principal components and Clustering EM estimation 
as in Lebret et al. (2015). In each iteration, rough clusters and outliers are 
also identified using our own method called RubikClust (R package ```KRIS```).

The R package ```IPCAPS``` requires the package ```KRIS```.

Here is the list of functions in the R package ```IPCAPS```:

* ```export.groups```
* ```get.node.info```
* ```ipcaps```
* ```save.html```
* ```save.plots```
* ```top.discriminator```

Moreover, here is the list of example datasets in the R package ```IPCAPS```:

* ```sim5pop```
* ```pop_labels```
* ```PCs```

## Installation

Install the released version of ```IPCAPS``` from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("IPCAPS")
```

## For developemenpers, problem sovling in checking the package as CRAN

### Error of Roxygen2 in building RD files

The source codes in this package include the Roxgen's syntax. If there is a 
problem for generating the RD files (facing some errors) using RStudio (_Build > 
Document_), try to use ```roxygen2::roxygenise()``` instead of _Build > Document_ 
from the menu. Alternatively, install the package ```devtools```, then enable 
RStudio to use the functions from ```devtools``` (check _Build > Configure Build 
Tools... > use devtools package functions if available_) or run 
```devtools::document()``` in the console.

### Error of testthat for unit testing

When facing error for ```testthat```, try to update the package ```testthat``` and add 
```Suggests: testthat``` in _DESCRIPTION_ file.
